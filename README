This is Liferay 6.0.x plugin for storing Lucene's index on Infinispan cluster.

::::: CAUTION ::::::

This version is not to support cluster yet. Only for Liferay with Infinispan.
This means that Infinispan and Liferay run on the same jvm.
So, if you stop Liferay, then Lucene's index will go out.
BE CAREFUL!!!
